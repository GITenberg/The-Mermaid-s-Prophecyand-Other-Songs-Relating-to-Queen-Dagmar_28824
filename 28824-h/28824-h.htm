5</span>SONGS RELATING TO QUEEN DAGMAR</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; KING VALDEMAR&rsquo;S WOOING.</h3>
<p>Valdemar King and Sir Strange bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At table sat one day,<br />
So many a word &rsquo;twixt them there passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In amicable way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear Strange, hear! thou for a time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy native land must leave;<br />
Thou shalt away to Bohemia far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My young bride to receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered Strange Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer he was not slow:<br />
&ldquo;Who shall attend me of thy liegemen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I to Bohemia go?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;Do thou take with thee young Lord Limbek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor leave Olaf Lukke behind;<br />
Take rich Peter Glob, and whomsoe&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall best please thine own mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Sealand&rsquo;s Bishop, none more learned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There dwelleth North nor South,<br />
And take Sir Albert of Eskilsea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s eloquence in his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the young Sir Strange bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He down to the sea shore wends,<br />
And him King Valdemar himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With nobles many attends.</p>
<p>And they sailed over the briny wave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They sailed for sennights three,<br />
The nearest way to Bohemia&rsquo;s bounds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were at heart so free.</p>
<p>They furled their sail, and their anchor dropped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the land they eagerly sped;<br />
So fair a band of knights they were,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Strange at their head.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>When a little up the land they&rsquo;d won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They dispatched their messenger,<br />
Should tell to Bohemia&rsquo;s prince that they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dane-king&rsquo;s envoys were.</p>
<p>And to speak with him in secrecy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a matter of weight they sought;<br />
Then silk upon the earth was spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And before the King they were brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, King of Bohemian Land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sittest a prince in state;<br />
To you sends Valdemar, Denmark&rsquo;s King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With your daughter he would mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take napkins, Sirs, and water take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit down at our table board;<br />
We bid ye welcome to our land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fit answer we&rsquo;ll award.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the bower high the monarch sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Queen&rsquo;s advice to take:<br />
&ldquo;Nobles are here from Denmark come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And suit for our daughter make.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;If Valdemar, King of Denmark&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For our dear daughter woo,<br />
We&rsquo;ll give her to the powerful man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And precious dowry too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They decked her with the ruddy gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her to the hall convey&rsquo;d;<br />
Sir Strange the knight, so fair and fine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A low obeisance made.</p>
<p>They clad her in the silken vest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her to the hall conveyed:<br />
&ldquo;Here mayst thou see the princess self<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her graces all arrayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they bore in the playing board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was wroughten all of gold;<br />
Sir Strange should with the princess play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And private converse hold.</p>
<p>The third game they together played<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon that red gold board,<br />
Sir Strange won the noble maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Valdemar his lord.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>So deep &rsquo;twas getting in the night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From tables they should rise,<br />
Sir Strange must the princess bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Strange bold and wise.</p>
<p>Then they the Damsel attend to bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the valiant cavalier,<br />
Sir Strange with respectful grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arose when she drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now on your honour and knightly truth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Strange tell to me:<br />
Whether the King of your Danish land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be handsome or not to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answer made Sir Strange good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked up to the star-lit sky:<br />
&ldquo;By the Saints above, the King of our love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is handsomer twice than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spread the silk upon the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the princess led to the strand,<br />
To her parents dear, she bade good-night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And away they bore from land.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>It was the good Bohemian King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To advising his daughter fell:<br />
&ldquo;Think, think my child, on honor and fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou in Denmark dwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pious and virtuous, kind and good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove thyself essay<br />
To thy subjects all, for thus wilt thou<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Become their hope and stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nobles steered their ship from the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No cares their hearts oppress,<br />
And they the land of Denmark made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In two months tide and less.</p>
<p>It was the beauteous Dagmar Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Mando neared the land,<br />
And lo! the bold King of Denmark rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His courser on the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Sir Strange Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere we come nearer land,<br />
What squinting fellow &rsquo;tis who rides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So brisk on the yellow sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Be welcome, beauteous Dagmar Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak thereabout no word;<br />
For know &rsquo;tis Valdemar of Denmark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of kingdoms three the lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious liege, lady Dagmar fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of princes he&rsquo;s the flower,<br />
He castles has, and fortresses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three kingdoms own his power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame, shame befall thee, Strange dog,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How loudly thou canst lie;<br />
Methinks your boasted Danish King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has only got one eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lovely Dame, a warrior he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the best beneath the sun;<br />
He back to Denmark all the land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Benorth Ebb&rsquo;s stream has won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man is he, and a prince full wise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face dares look his foes;<br />
They fly before him both East and West,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he with fury glows.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Who others life and land will risk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And prove war&rsquo;s pastime fell,<br />
If a prince of blood and courageous mood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will risk himself as well?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do thou hear, my lovely maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be cheerful and content,<br />
For ne&rsquo;er so long as thou shalt live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This step thou shalt repent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the time that thou shalt live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your servant I will be,<br />
And Denmark&rsquo;s gallant nobles all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall bow to thee their knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they their bridal solemnized<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath a lucky star;<br />
So heartily one another loved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Valdemar and Dagmar.</p>
<p>There was rejoicing with great and small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With rich men and with poor,<br />
But boors and burgers most of all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejoiced from their heart&rsquo;s core.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>She came not to burden, she came in peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ease the good boor she came;<br />
If Denmark aye such flowers had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She dearly would prize the same!</p>
<p>The love of every Danish heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good Queen Dagmar gained;<br />
Such happy pleasant days there were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst she alive remained.</p>
<h3><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>II.&nbsp; QUEEN DAGMAR&rsquo;S ARRIVAL IN DENMARK.</h3>
<p>It was Bohemia&rsquo;s Queen began<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daughter to direct:<br />
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll show thee, when thou to Denmark come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much honor and respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when respect and honor thou win<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Denmark&rsquo;s land of fame,<br />
Let not the boors be with tax opprest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus will they bless thy name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the first boon thou of thy lord dost crave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thy lord so fair and kind,<br />
That he release Bishop Valdemar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His uncle, who sits confin&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>And there was silk and scarlet cloth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the earth outspread;<br />
&rsquo;Twas Dagmar, the youthful princess fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the strand that down was led.</p>
<p>They hoisted up their silken sails<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the gilded yard so high,<br />
And they in less than two months space<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Denmark could descry.</p>
<p>Before Mando they anchor cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They cast it on the white sand;<br />
They took the princess Dagmar fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bore her first to land.</p>
<p>They took the youthful Dagmar fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bore her first to land;<br />
&rsquo;Twas Valdemar King of Denmark old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That stretched to her his hand.</p>
<p>Then there was silk, and scarlet cloth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wide on the earth outspread;<br />
On Dagmar wait both Dames and maids,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Ribe house she was led.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>So early in the morning tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere the sun illumed the lift,<br />
&rsquo;Twas young and beauteous Dagmar Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That craved her morning gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first, first boon that I crave of thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart&rsquo;s beloved lord,<br />
Let Bishop Valdemar leave his tower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be to his friends restor&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second boon I most earnestly crave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor must thou that refuse,<br />
Take off from each plough the tax that&rsquo;s on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from prison the captives loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desist, desist from thy first prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Desist, my Dagmar dear,<br />
If Valdemar Bishop come but out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll widow thee in a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the gold crown off her brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table that she set:<br />
&ldquo;O what shall I do in Denmark, now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My request denial has met?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;Straight fetch to me hither Sir Strange
knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Younker Canute to me call,<br />
They shall away to Oringsdorg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the prisoners free from thrall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when from the tower forth he came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor walk nor stand he mought:<br />
&ldquo;Therein for full twelve years I sat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So long the time I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A golden comb his sister took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And combed his yellow hair;<br />
For every lock of his she smoothed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She shed a briny tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do thou hear, dear sister mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne&rsquo;er sorrow for my sake;<br />
If I one single year survive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll well my wrongs ywrake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O hush, Bishop Valdemar! nor let<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fury o&rsquo;er thee reign;<br />
Comst thou once more into Seaborough tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We ne&rsquo;er shall meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>But the Bishop could not stifle his wrath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So the land he was forced to quit;<br />
It grieved Queen Dagmar to the heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he showed so little wit.</p>
<p>There was great joy over all Denmark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Dagmar for Queen they had got;<br />
Lived burger and boor in peace without<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The plague of plough-tax and scot.</p>
<p>Christ bless the youthful Athelings two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lengthen their vital span,<br />
That justice they may, and equity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do long in sight of man!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll stick thee on this spit, I
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Then home came Rosmer Shank-stretcher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus in anger he began:<br />
&ldquo;Full certainly there&rsquo;s hither come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Christian woman, child, or man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then forward stepped she, Ellenlile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And swore so high and solemnly:<br />
&ldquo;A crow which bore a dead man&rsquo;s leg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en now across the house did fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crow which bore a dead man&rsquo;s leg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now across our house did fly;<br />
He cast it in, I cast it out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that I trow full speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rosmer shrieked and sprang about:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Some Christian wight thon dost conceal,<br />
And I will spit and burn thee, Dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the truth thou dost reveal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ellenlile her mantle donned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And went and stood by Rosmer&rsquo;s knee:<br />
&ldquo;O here&rsquo;s a swain from Iceland come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s of nearest kin to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a swain from Iceland come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And if he be thy kinsman near,<br />
Then I to him will safety pledge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No harm from me he need to fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he two years in the sea had been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Roland he would fain be gone;<br />
For Ellenlile was now with child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A deed of folly had been done.</p>
<p>When that perceived proud Ellenlile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Near Rosmer King she took her stand:<br />
&ldquo;Now wilt thou give the stranger lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave to return to his own land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the swain for home doth long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I will take him to the shore;<br />
And I will give him silver and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in a coffer it will store.</p>
<p>And so he took the ruddy gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in a coffer it he laid;<br />
Unknown to him proud Ellenlile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sly therein herself convey&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>He takes the man beneath his arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The coffer on his back he throws;<br />
Then away, away beneath the salt spray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Striding the Giant Rosmer goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now have I brought thee to the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And moon and sun thou canst behold;<br />
And now to use as thou shalt chuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I give this coffer filled with gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank thee, Rosmer, honest man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;st brought me out of the ocean wild;<br
/>
And now I&rsquo;ll tell thee a piece of news,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The proud Dame Ellen is with child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then ran the tears down Rosmer&rsquo;s cheeks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As falls the dew on hill and plain:<br />
&ldquo;If thou hadst not my troth and oath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here as thou standest thee I&rsquo;d
brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosmer hied to the hill so fast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As hind before the hart doth run;<br />
And when he came within the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold proud Ellenlile was gone.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>But Ellenlile took Roland&rsquo;s hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Midst sport and jest away they hied;<br />
To young Roland she told her tale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Roland served her as a guide.</p>
<p>When Rosmer saw his love was gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So full was he of grief and dool,<br />
He turned him into a huge grey rock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there he standeth like a fool.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
